            <h1>What are Exoplanets?</h1>
            <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet">Exoplanets</a>, also known as extrasolar planets,
            are planets that exist outside our solar system, orbiting stars
            other than the Sun. These distant worlds have been a subject of
            fascination and intense scientific study, shedding light on the vast
            diversity of planetary systems in the universe.

            <h1>History of Exoplanets</h1>
            Exoplanets were first discovered in the 1990s, marking a
            significant milestone in astronomy. The first exoplanet was
            discovered in 1992. In fact, the first discovery wasn't just 1
            planet it was 2! Poltergeist and Phobetor were found orbiting a
            pulsar called PSR B1257+12. In 1994, a much smaller 3rd planet was
            found in the system, named Draugr. These new worlds opened a new
            field of astronomy and were soon followed by other discoveries! Over
            the years, various methods have been employed to detect exoplanets,
            with the most successful approach being the transit method. This
            method involves observing the slight dimming of a star's light as a
            planet passes in front of it, revealing the presence of the planet.
